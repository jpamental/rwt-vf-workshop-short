# rwt-vf-workshop-short
Working files for the shortened version of my workshop on using variable fonts and modern CSS techniques.

## Initial setup
To make use of the `gulp` process, you need to have `npm` and `gulp` installed.

Once both are installed, follow these steps:
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project root
Execute the command `npm install`

## Running the `gulp` process
If the initial setup has been completed, executing the command `gulp` from the root of the project will start the 'watch' task and the local server with BrowserSync.
