# Responsive Web Typography Variable Font Workshop (short)
Working files for the shortened version of my workshop on using variable fonts and modern CSS techniques.

## Initial setup
To make use of the `gulp` process, you need to have `npm` and `gulp` installed.

Once both are installed, follow these steps:
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project root
Execute the command `npm install`

## Running the `gulp` process
If the initial setup has been completed, executing the command `gulp` from the root of the project will start the 'watch' task and the local server with BrowserSync.

## Simple Setup (Plain CSS approach)
If you want to skip all the 'build tools' you can just edit the files in the `css` directory instead. Just remember that if you do that and then try the build process later, you will lose any changes you make to `rwt_vf_styles.css` so be sure to make a copy to bring those changes back into the source Sass file (located in `scss/rwt_vf_styles.scss`).
